                    <h3 >THE REGERA - A NEW ERA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The new Roadster  Regera is specifically designed to be a luxury Megacar 
                        alternative to Roadster's traditional extreme, light weight, race-like 
                        road cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While traditional Roadsters have always had surprising levels of practicality, 
                        creature comforts and features, our primary focus has always been to make 
                        the fastest cars on the planet - around a racetrack or anywhere else. The 
                        Roadster Regera continues this tradition, but with innovative technology that 
                        blends outrageous speed, supreme comfort and a unique Direct Drive experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Regera will be handcrafted in an edition of just 80 vehicles in Roadster's 
                        newly upgraded and refurbished Angelholm production facility; the first time 
                        ever that Roadster will have two different models in parallel production.
                    </p>
                        
                    <h3 >KOENIGSEGG DIRECT DRIVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Koenigsegg Direct Drive transmission (KDD) was invented by 
                        Christian von Koenigsegg and developed for the Regera by the Koenigsegg Advanced 
                        Engineering team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The patent-pending KDD replaces the combustion engine’s traditional transmission – 
                        the gearbox as you know it is removed from the car. In its place, the KDD provides 
                        direct drive to the rear axle from the combustion engine without the need of multitude 
                        gears or a variable transmissions, all of which have inherently high energy losses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During highway travel, for example, the KDD reduces drivetrain losses compared to a 
                        traditional transmission or CVT by over 50% as there is no step up or step down gear 
                        working in series with the final drive – just direct power sent from the engine to the 
                        wheels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Regera has three YASA developed electric motors, which supplement the energy from 
                        the combustion engine. Aside from providing extreme responsiveness, these electric motors 
                        also allow for torque vectoring, regenerative braking and energy conversion. YASA´s axial 
                        flux motors are extremely power dense, making them a key-ingredient for the KDD. There is 
                        one YASA motor for each rear wheel, providing electric direct drive, and one on the crankshaft 
                        that provides torque-fill, electrical generation and starter motor functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three electric motors constitute the most powerful electrical motor set-up in production 
                        car history, replacing the gears of a normal transmission. This provides all-important weight 
                        savings as well as adding power, torque and torque vectoring capability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="text-center"><img src="images/Regera-Drive-Rendering-1440-930x503.jpg" width="60%"></div>
                    <p>
                        Finally, there is the battery pack’s weight. Through research and investment in premium battery 
                        technology, the production version of the Regera will ship with a battery pack that not only 
                        performs better, but weighs just 75kgs, a saving of 40kgs over the concept battery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every cell of the pack is carefully monitored for voltage, state of charge, health and temperature. 
                        The cells are enclosed in a carbon fibre casing for efficiency, safety and stability. The battery is 
                        located in the most protected area of the car – the carbon-aramid chassis tunnel.
                    </p>
                        To put the revolutionary nature of the Regera into proper perspective, it has almost triple as many 
                        electric horsepower (700hp) than its closest hybrid rival, with over 300hp more in total horsepower. 
                        And yet the Regera remains at a very competitive weight, while still including features such as a 
                        six way adjustable electrical seat and a fully robotized body work.
